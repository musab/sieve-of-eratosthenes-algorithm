## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- node (I'm working on v12.16.1)

### Setup

Begin by running the node server:

```
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

Once the server is running, start the client

```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

The client can then be accessed via `http://localhost:3000`.

### Misc

To run the tests, in either `server` or `client` execute the following:

```
npm test
```
