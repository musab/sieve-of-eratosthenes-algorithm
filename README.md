## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- node (I'm working on v12.16.1)

### Setup

**The Docker Way**

The application is fully dockerized, and is the easiest way to start the application.

From the root directory run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

> Ensure you have Docker Desktop running.

**The Non Docker Way**

Begin by running the node server:

```
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

Once the server is running, start the client

```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

### Misc

To run the tests, in either `server` or `client` execute the following:

```
npm test
```
